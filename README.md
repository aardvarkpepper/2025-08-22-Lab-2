## NOTES

https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html

For local MongoDB databases, we recommend using 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost. That is because Node.js 18 and up prefer IPv6 addresses, which means, on many machines, Node.js will resolve localhost to the IPv6 address ::1 and Mongoose will be unable to connect, unless the mongodb instance is running with ipv6 enabled.
